> Madden GIFERATOR recreation in a Discord bot.

## Getting Started

### Public Instance 

[If you do not wish to host it yourself, you may add the public instance to your server.](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=applications.commands+bot&client_id=815181449028042762)

### Installation

To host giferator yourself

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vord1080/giferator
cd giferator
npm install
```
then fill in config.json and start the bot like so:
```bash
node src/index.js
```
Some required assets are not included for legal reasons (fonts, backgrounds, foregrounds). You need to find these yourself ;)
